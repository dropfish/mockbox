    "poem.txt": "I.<br>We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon;<br>How restlessly they speed and gleam and quiver,<br>Streaking the darkness radiantly! yet soon<br>Night closes round, and they are lost for ever:—<br>II.<br>Or like forgotten lyres whose dissonant strings<br>Give various response to each varying blast,<br>To whose frail frame no second motion brings<br>One mood or modulation like the last.<br>III.<br>We rest—a dream  has power to poison sleep;<br>We rise—one wandering thought pollutes the day;<br>We feel, conceive or reason, laugh or weep,<br>Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away:—<br>IV.<br>It is the same!—For, be it joy or sorrow,<br>The path of its departure still is free;<br>Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;<br>Nought may endure but Mutability.",
